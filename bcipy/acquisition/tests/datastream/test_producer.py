# These tests are not slow but they sometimes fail during continuous
# integration checks. Producers are used in mock development servers,
# but are not critical to production use of BciPy so they are being
# temporarily marked as slow to ensure that they are skipped during
# integration. The tests may be run locally to ensure correct behavior.
