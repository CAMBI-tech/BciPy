# BciPy Feedback

This module contains the feedback classes used in BciPy. Feedback is the process of providing real-time information to the user about their brain activity, typically through visual or auditory stimuli. The feedback classes in this module are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing researchers to create a wide range of feedback paradigms.

## Feedback Classes

The feedback classes in this module include:

- `Feedback`: The base class for all feedback classes. It provides the basic functionality for sending feedback to the user.
- `VisualFeedback`: Provides visual feedback to the user based on their brain activity.
- `AuditoryFeedback`: Provides auditory feedback to the user based on their brain activity.
