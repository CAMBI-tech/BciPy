# RSVP Keyboard GUI
======================================

This module contains all GUI code used in BciPy. The base window class, BCIGui, is contained in gui_main.py, and contains methods for easily adding widgets to a given window. BCInterface.py launches the main GUI window. There are also interfaces for collecting and editing data (parameters and field data for experiments.)

## Dependencies
-------------
This project was written in wxPython version 4.0.4 and PyQt5 5.15.1. We are deprecating the wxPython UIs in future releases.
