# Signal

The BciPy Signal module contains all code needed to process, model, and generate signals for Brain Computer Interface control using EEG. Further documentation provided in submodule READMEs.

# Evaluate

Evaluates signal based on configured rules.

# Process

The process module contains functions for decomposing signals into frequency bands (psd, cwt), filtering signals (bandpass, notch), and other signal processing functions.

# Model

Modeling needed to classify signals. See signal/model/README.md for more detailed information.

# Generator

Generates fake signal data.
